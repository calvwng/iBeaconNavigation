* Room Navigation Workflow to implement:
  When target room is selected, check if corresponding beacon is detected.
  If detected, launch only FloorplanNavigationActivity.
  Else launch Google Nav routing to the building corresponding to the room's beacon
     & start BuildingProximityService to poll for the room's beacon.
       When room's beacon is detected, then launch FloorplanNavigationActivity.

* Implement Building Search => launching of Room Search

* Implement Room Search => launching of Room Navigation Workflow

* Implement Room favoriting
