* Create custom Google Maps Activity "MapActivity" to be launched from MainActivity

* Retrieve user location in MapActivity
~ Was achieved through the creation of and connection to a Google API Client, but left unused
until we really deem it necessary.

* Show route to Frank E. Pilling CSC building from user location (w/ option to start nav)

~ found out that real-time nav or waypoint pulling w/o passing it off to GMaps app is not allowed
(See 10.2 (d) of https://developers.google.com/maps/terms)

~ Went from launching navigation app from an intent parsing a URI, to a custom MapActivity w/ MapFragment, 
to a webView for just directions, back to custom MapActivity b/c realized there were buttons after tapping
on the marker (so need to indicate to user that they must manually trigger the directions/nav, then return)

~ Maybe I should go back to the URI approach since that launches directly into navigation, and just launch
a Service (in Activity's onPause() to check when I need to bring our indoor navigation logic to the foreground, 
if possible; if not possible, then wait until user backs out of GMaps app, and perform switch in onResume())

~ Another thought is to use an overlayed notification that interrupts the user in GMaps and gives them
the option to go to our app's indoor navigation logic

* Detect (or wait until MapActivity regains focus, manually) when destination building reached 
~ through nav if applicable https://developer.android.com/training/location/receive-location-updates.html
~ else check for building's iBeacons

* once at destination building, switch MapFragment with IndoorMapFragment for indoor room navigation logic

* Research Android permissions for app use outside of debug mode?
http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html

* Look into using a GoogleMaps.Overlay class instead of floorplan?
