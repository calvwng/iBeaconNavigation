* Create custom Google Maps Activity "MapActivity" to be launched from MainActivity

* Retrieve user location in MapActivity
~ Was achieved through the creation of and connection to a Google API Client, but left unused
until we really deem it necessary.

* Show route to Frank E. Pilling CSC building from user location (w/ option to start nav)
~ found out that real-time nav or waypoint pulling w/o passing it off to GMaps app is not allowed
~ See 10.2 (d) of https://developers.google.com/maps/terms
~ Went from launching navigation app from an intent parsing a URI, to a custom MapActivity w/ MapFragment, 
to a webView for just directions, back to custom MapActivity b/c realized there were buttons after tapping
on the marker (so need to indicate to user that they must manually trigger the directions/nav, then return)

* Detect when destination building reached (through nav if applicable, else check for building's iBeacons)

* finish() MapActivity when building reached, and switch MapFragment with IndoorMapFragment for
  indoor room navigation logic

* Research Android permissions for app use outside of debug mode?
http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/security/permissions.html

* Look into using a GoogleMaps.Overlay class instead of floorplan?
